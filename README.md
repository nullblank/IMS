# IMS
The IMS (Information Management System) is an information system developed in C#. This was made in compliance of my OJT (On-The-Job-Training) requirements. This was also made to assist Saint Mary's University's IMO Office (Inventory Management Office) in logging deliveries, resupplies, current stockpile inventory, and financial auditing.
The Features include but are not limited to:
- Inventory Stockpile Tracking.
- Encrypted Accounts.
- Account Permissions Access.
- Verbose user action logging (Includes actions that modify records)
- Report generation for auditing and financial reports.
